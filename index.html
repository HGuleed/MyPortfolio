        <h2>about ME</h2>
        <p>I was born in 1996 in Abu Dhabi, UAE to immigrant parents who came from Somalia. When I was between the ages of three and four we moved to the United States. Originally we settled down in Charlotte, North Carolina after a couple of years we relocated to Columbus, Ohio and we have lived here ever since. The majority of my schooling was done in the South Western city school district. I attended Westland High School and graduated with a fairly high GPA. Once I graduated I got accepted into The Ohio State University, specifically into their engineering program, with the goal of becoming a chemical engineer. I did not end up attending OSU because I had a change of heart about what I wanted to do with my future at that time. Over the years I have applied and been accepted to many colleges, but always ended up getting cold feet over the major. I am so happy to say I found my passion for coding and canâ€™t wait to be able to start my future as a programmer.</p>
