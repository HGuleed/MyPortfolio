        <h2>about ME</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I was born in 1996 in Abu Dhabi, UAE to immigrant parents who came
            from Somalia. When I was between the ages of three and four we moved
            to the United States. Originally we settled down in Charlotte, North
            Carolina after a couple of years we relocated to Columbus, Ohio and we
            have lived here ever since. The majority of my schooling was done in
            the South Western city school district. I attended Westland High
            School and graduated with a fairly high GPA. Once I graduated I got
            accepted into The Ohio State University, specifically into their
            engineering program, with the goal of becoming a chemical engineer. I
            did not end up attending OSU because I had a change of heart about
            what I wanted to do with my future at that time. Over the years I have
            applied and been accepted to many colleges, but always ended up
            getting cold feet over the major. I am so happy to say I found my
            passion for coding and canâ€™t wait to be able to start my future as a
            programmer.
